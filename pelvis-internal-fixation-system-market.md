<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvis Internal Fixation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locking</li><li>Non-Locking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pelvis Internal Fixation System market is divided mainly into two types: locking and non-locking systems. Locking systems utilize screws that engage with the plate, providing enhanced stability and resistance to angular and axial loads, making them ideal for complex fractures. Non-locking systems rely on friction between screws and plates for fixation, which may be easier to use in some cases but offer less stability. Both types cater to varying clinical needs based on specific fracture types and patient requirements.</p></p>
