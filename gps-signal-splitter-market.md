<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GPS Signal Splitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The GPS signal splitter market is divided into two main types: active and passive. Active splitters amplify the GPS signal before distributing it to multiple receivers, ensuring a strong and consistent signal even over longer distances. They require power to operate. In contrast, passive splitters simply divide the signal without amplification, making them suitable for short distances and low-power applications. Both types serve diverse needs in various industries, balancing signal integrity with system requirements.</p></p>
